## Motivation
There is a lot of collaboration in programming: many projects require sharing your code with other developers. Using open web resources such as Pastebin is not always an option. In this project, I created my own secure version of a code-sharing platform.
### Built with
 * [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 
* [Maven Build Tool](https://www.apache.org/) 
* [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/) 
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
## Key Feauters
 1. UUID-based Code Sharing: Each code snippet receives a unique UUID, ensuring clear identification and accessibility for all shared pieces.
 2. Access Restrictions: Developers can set access restrictions based on the number of views or a defined time limit, enhancing security and control over shared code.
 3. User-friendly Interface: With an intuitive design, the platform facilitates easy navigation and interaction for users of all expertise levels.
